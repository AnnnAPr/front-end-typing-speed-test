# Typing speed test

Typing speed test is a web app allows user to check how many correct words per minutes user can type using keyboard.

There are two branches: main and user. "Main" branch doesn't show user name, "user" branch does show user name for "best score" feature. Please refer to "user" branch as it has the main functionality. 

## Tech stack

* Backend: Node JS and Express JS
* Frontend: React, Javascript
* Database: MongoDB Atlas
* Deployment: Heroku (backend)

Working with the React JS library:

* Sending data to nested components through props
* Receiving and using props within a component
* Initializing and using state within a component
* Passing callback functions to child components and use them to update state

## Goal

Goal is to create a typing speed test web app so user could check the number of correct words user types per minute using keyboard, to learn new things during creating full stack web app.

### User should be able:

* Restart test using "restart" button
* Get the best global score with bar charts info and name of person
* Get bar chart info for each reference text
* Save result and user name after test completed
* Can pet the orange cat and can move it all over the page.
* Press the key button and get the sound immitating the typing on the old typing machine

### Main features:

* Current word for typing is bold and black color
* Correct word is a green color
* Incorrect word is a red color
* At the different range of time timer has different color of circle
* Pop up modals with bar charts could be closed by clicking "closed" button or by clicking outside of modal


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
